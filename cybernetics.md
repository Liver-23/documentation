# Cybernetics

Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary branch of mathematics studying the behavior of dynamic systems.  Derived from the Greek word, kubernḗtēs, meaning pilot or steersman, the term cybernetics was first used in 1948 by American mathematician Norbert Wiener to describe the newly established science of command and control in animals and machines.

Cybernetics suggests that the world is composed of constantly changing loops of information.  Cascadia shall implement two types of feedback loops.  One loop will make adjustments based on observation of the system’s output, enabling learning.  The other will recognize environmental changes and replace obsolete information in the system with new data, enabling evolution.
