# Utility

A blockchain’s economic activity is shaped by three main groups:

* Demand-side agents (such as traders, entrepreneurs, and other protocols) drive expansion of cash flows in the economy and are ultimately the target audience for which a network is originally created.
* Supply-side participants (such as liquidity providers, builders, and validators) offer the resources required for Cascadia to run smoothly.

Token holders, in exchange for a share of the benefits from the economy’s performance, assume the risks involved in managing Cascadia’s resources.

Holding bCC grants holders the right to:

* Receive network gas fees;
* Receive token emissions;
* Receive fees from native protocols (nProtocols);
* Vote on gauge distribution for nProtocols and future blockchain development; and
* Engage in participatory tokenomics activities.
