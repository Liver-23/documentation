# VeTokenomics

Vote-escrowed is a mechanism where users are incentivized to lock their tokens for a specified duration. Cascadia refers to this process as ''align''. Users align CC to receive bCC.

You have the flexibility to adjust the duration of your alignment, either longer or shorter.

Our core idea is to incentivize stability. When you align CC tokens, you're making a pledge not to sell or transfer them for a certain period, which helps ensure a steady user base. As a result, the network becomes more resilient and secure.

Aligned tokens aren't idle. They serve a function in Cascadia's governance. More specifically, bCC has voting power for important decisions shaping the network's future.



**What are the benefits?**

Aligning tokens in a veTokenomics model presents several advantages:

1. **Long-Term Rewards:** The system is designed to reward patience and long-term commitment. The longer you align your tokens, the greater benefits you can accrue, which may include a higher yield or more tokens over time.
2. **Governance Participation:** Aligned tokens often confer voting rights, enabling holders to participate in governance matters. This process allows all participants to contribute to key decisions regarding the project's future.
3. **Flexibility:** Cascadia's alignment process isn't rigid. Users can decide the extent of their alignment based on their comfort level, aligning anything from a fraction to all of their total holdings.

bCC token holders, in exchange for a share of the benefits from the ecosystem's performance, manage Cascadiaâ€™s resources. Holding bCC grants holders the right to:

* Receive network gas fees.
* Receive token emissions.
* Receive fees from native protocols (nProtocols).
* Vote on gauge distribution for nProtocols and future blockchain development.
* Engage in participatory tokenomics activities.



**What are the drawbacks?**

Despite its advantages, veTokenomics comes with certain challenges:

1. **Token Liquidity:** Once you align your tokens, they're not immediately available for transactions. You'll have to wait until the alignment period ends, which could be a limitation for users needing liquidity.
2. **Market Volatility:** The value of your tokens might fluctuate during the alignment period. If the token's value decreases, your aligned tokens could be worth less when they're finally available.
3. **Complexity for New Users:** VeTokenomics, with its unique alignment and cooldown processes, can be complex for new users to understand, potentially creating a barrier to entry.
