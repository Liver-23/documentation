# Off-Chain

Off-chain governance plays its role in building a sensible debate. It allows fluid conversations, nuanced discussions, and diverse participation. Off-chain governance in Cascadia primarily takes place in Discord.

Off-chain governance involves informal votes, discussions on upcoming proposals, the formation of workstreams, and brainstorming sessions. These interactions often lead to formal proposals in the on-chain governance model. It is important to note that decisions made off-chain do not directly modify the protocol but heavily influence on-chain decision-making.
