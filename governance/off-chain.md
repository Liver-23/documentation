# Off-Chain

Off-chain governance plays its role in building a sensible debate. It allows fluid conversations, nuanced discussions, and diverse participation. Off-chain governance in Cascadia primarily takes place in Discord.

**Scope and Nature**

The scope of off-chain governance extends beyond informal votes. It encompasses the preliminary discussions on impending proposals, the establishment of workstreams, and brainstorming sessions. These interactions often germinate ideas that gradually evolve into formal on-chain governance proposals. It's important to remember that while off-chain decisions do not directly affect the protocol, they significantly influence the direction of on-chain decision-making.

**Process**

In off-chain governance, the process begins with the introduction of an idea. Any user can present their idea in the dedicated channel on the Discord platform. Ideas should be concise, clearly articulated, and must encompass the potential impact on the network.

After the idea is introduced, it becomes a subject of discussion among the community. Other users can express their thoughts, provide constructive criticism, or suggest modifications. The open dialogue enables the initial idea to be refined and moulded through the community's collective intelligence.

**Drafting a Detailed Proposal**

If the idea gains traction and community support, it can be crafted into a detailed proposal. The proposal must contain specific components such as:

* The proposal's purpose
* Detailed description of the proposal
* The potential impact on the network
* A plan for implementation, if applicable

_Example:_

''Title: Reduction of Alignment Period for bCC Acquisition

Purpose: To decrease the alignment period required for bCC acquisition from X days to Y days.

Description: The proposal aims to reduce the current alignment period of X days to Y days, making it more efficient for users to acquire bCC and participate in governance.

Impact: This change would potentially increase the number of bCC holders, thereby expanding the governance participant pool. It may also encourage more frequent participation in governance decisions.

Implementation Plan: The technical team would adjust the smart contract parameters to reduce the alignment period, with thorough testing before final implementation.''

**Proposal Evaluation and Progression**

Once drafted, the proposal can be moved into the formal review phase. Here, it undergoes a more thorough examination by the community. If the proposal garners substantial community support in the off-chain discussion, it can then be moved to the on-chain environment for official voting.

By using off-chain governance in this manner, Cascadia ensures that the ideas and proposals introduced into the formal on-chain governance system are well-thought-out, refined, and supported by a significant portion of the community. The open and transparent process of off-chain governance thus plays a crucial role in shaping the future of Cascadia.
