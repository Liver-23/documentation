# Parameters

The voting period spans 3 days, and a quorum is achieved when at least 33% of the voting power participates. The pass threshold is 50% of participating voting power. Participants can choose from Yes, No, or Abstain options during the voting period, and may change their vote before the period ends.



**Features**

bCC holders can vote on proposals and the current module supports these traits:

1. Proposal submission: Users with at least 6,102 bCC can submit proposals, initiating the voting period.&#x20;
2. Vote: During the voting period, anyone can vote on a proposal with at least over 0 bCC.



**Criteria for Approving Governance Proposals**&#x20;

Two factors determine the outcome of a governance proposal.

1. A quorum requires at least 33% of the network's total voting power (based on bCC balances) to participate.
2. Over 50% of participating voting power must support a Yes vote by the end of the 3-day voting period.
3. The same criteria apply to submit and determine the outcome of all proposal types.
