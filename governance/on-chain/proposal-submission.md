Every bCC holder has the ability to submit proposals. It's a reflection of true decentralization, where anyone has the opportunity to steer the direction of the network's growth.



**How to Submit a Proposal**

A minimum of 6102 bCC tokens are necessary to submit a proposal. Proposals should provide a specific voting period, details on the proposed changes, potential impact, and other related information. See [here](https://cascadia.gitbook.io/gitbook/governance/drafting-a-proposal).



**Considerations**

Potential proposers must take into account the immediate and long-term effects on the network before submitting a proposal. It is encouraged to have thorough discussions and deliberation prior to proposal submission. It is also important to note that during the proposal process and voting period, holding the minimum amount of 6102 bCC is required.
