# Voting Process

**Voting Period**

The voting period for each proposal is set to 3 days, giving everyone ample time to review the details, deliberate, and cast their votes. During this period, bCC holders may cast their vote with the aforementioned options. Voters can change their decision any time before the voting period concludes.



**Voting Threshold**

The decision threshold is set at 50%. This represents the necessary level of support a proposal must achieve to be passed during a voting cycle. Specifically, more than half of the total voting power participating in the vote must cast their votes in favour of a proposal.



**Voting Power**

The voting power of each account is proportional to the amount of bCC it holds. More specifically 1 bCC = 1 vote. The total voting power for a proposal equals the sum of bCC participating in the vote.&#x20;



**Vote Tallying**

When the voting period ends, the votes are tallied. The decision, whether it is approved or rejected, depends on the majority vote, keeping in mind the necessary quorum threshold.
