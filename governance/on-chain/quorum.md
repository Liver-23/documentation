# Quorum

**Establishing Quorum**&#x20;

Voting power, whether supporting Yes, No or Abstain, contributes to the quorum. A quorum is necessary for a governance proposal to be approved.



**Outcome**

The outcome of the vote can result in the implementation of the proposed changes or maintaining the status quo, depending on the decision. A successful proposal leads to the execution of changes as detailed in the proposal, while a failed proposal retains the current conditions.
