# Temperature Check

A Temperature Check (TC) is initiated to discuss a potential modification to Cascadia. The aim of a TC is to develop through community discussion into a Cascadia Improvement Proposal (CIP).

TCs are intended to provide a consistent pathway for proposing changes to Cascadia. This ensures all members can have confidence that Cascadia is evolving in line with its ecosystem and that all members have an opportunity to be heard.

If the initial idea from the [off-chain](https://cascadia.gitbook.io/gitbook/governance/off-chain) discussion gains support from the contributors and the community alike, it can be crafted into a more detailed proposal. The proposal must contain specific elements such as:

1. **Author:** Who is proposing the idea?&#x20;
2. **Title:** A clear title of the proposal.&#x20;
3. **Summary:** A brief 1-2 sentences outlining the main points.&#x20;
4. **Background/Main Body:** This is the main subject of the proposal
5. **Specification:** An explanation of the proposed solution.&#x20;
6. **Voting:** The outline of the exact voting options.



**Next Steps**&#x20;

Once a TC has matured through community discussion, the next step is to transform it into a Cascadia Improvement Proposal (CIP). A CIP is a detailed proposal that, if approved, results in changes to the Cascadia protocol.

CIPs follow a similar format to TCs but are typically more technical and detailed.

The progression from a TC to a CIP is a collaborative process. Community feedback and discussion are crucial at each step to ensure any changes are beneficial for Cascadia's ecosystem.

Remember, the ultimate goal of the TCs and the resulting CIPs is to ensure that the decisions made are in the best interest and result in continuous improvement.
