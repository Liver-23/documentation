# Temperature Check

A Temperature Check (TC) is initiated to discuss a potential modification to Cascadia. If the initial idea from the [off-chain](https://cascadia.gitbook.io/gitbook/governance/off-chain) discussion gains support from the contributors and the community alike, it can be crafted into a more detailed proposal. The aim of a TC is to develop through community discussion into a Cascadia Improvement Proposal (CIP).

TCs are intended to provide a consistent pathway for proposing changes to Cascadia. This ensures all members can have confidence that Cascadia is evolving in line with its ecosystem and that all members have an opportunity to be heard.

&#x20;The proposal must contain specific elements such as:

1. **Author:** Who is proposing the idea?&#x20;
2. **Title:** A clear title of the proposal.&#x20;
3. **Summary:** A brief 1-2 sentences outlining the main points.&#x20;
4. **Background/Main Body:** This is the main subject of the proposal
5. **Specification:** An explanation of the proposed solution.&#x20;
6. **Voting:** The outline of the exact voting options.



_Example:_

> **Author**: Jane Doe
>
> \
> **Title**: TC for Adjusting Block Rewards in Cascadia
>
> **Summary**: This Temperature Check aims to spark discussions about the possibility of modifying block reward distribution within the Cascadia ecosystem.
>
> \
> **Background/Main Body**:
>
> Cascadia, in its pursuit of a sustainable, inclusive, and thriving decentralized ecosystem, always seeks to incentivize contributors to its protocol. However, current block rewards allocation has been noticed to be less appealing to some minor contributors and may discourage new participants from joining.
>
> While the existing block reward distribution was designed to sustain the ecosystem and fairly reward contributors based on their input, we have observed a trend of minor contributors exiting the ecosystem due to perceived inadequate rewards for their efforts.
>
> This issue, if not addressed, may affect the long-term health of the network, as diversity in contribution is vital to the growth and resilience of Cascadia. Thus, this TC aims to gather the community's thoughts on this matter and explore potential solutions.
>
> \
> **Specification**:
>
> The suggested modification revolves around adjusting the block reward algorithm to allocate a slightly higher percentage of rewards to minor contributors, while still retaining a merit-based system.
>
> This adjustment could involve implementing a minimum guaranteed reward for active participants, then distributing the remaining rewards based on the current proportional contribution system. The goal is to encourage minor contributors without disrupting the existing incentive structure too drastically.
>
> \
> **Voting**:
>
> We will conduct a vote following the discussion phase of this TC.
>
> Options for voting will include:
>
> 1. Support for implementing the adjusted reward system as outlined above.
> 2. Support for a modified version of the proposed reward system (details to be specified by the contributors during discussions).
> 3. Rejection of the proposal, with preference for maintaining the current reward system.
>
> \
> **Next Steps**:
>
> Should this TC gain substantial support and constructive feedback, we will refine the proposal into a Cascadia Improvement Proposal (CIP) that elaborates the technical aspects and potential impacts of the changes.
>
> As always, community discussion and consensus will be a pivotal part of this process. We encourage all Cascadia members to participate and voice their views to ensure that we continue to advance in the best interest of the Cascadia ecosystem.



**Next Steps**&#x20;

Once a TC has matured through community discussion, the next step is to transform it into a Cascadia Improvement Proposal (CIP). A CIP is a detailed proposal that, if approved, results in changes to the Cascadia protocol.

CIPs follow a similar format to TCs but are typically more technical and detailed.

The progression from a TC to a CIP is a collaborative process. Community feedback and discussion are crucial at each step to ensure any changes are beneficial for Cascadia's ecosystem.

Remember, the ultimate goal of the TCs and the resulting CIPs is to ensure that the decisions made are in the best interest and result in continuous improvement.
