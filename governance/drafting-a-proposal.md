# Drafting a Proposal

If the initial idea from the [off-chain](https://cascadia.gitbook.io/gitbook/governance/off-chain) discussion gains support from the contributors and the community, it can be crafted into a detailed proposal. The proposal must contain specific elements such as:

1. **Title:** Summarize the main idea.
2. **Objective:** State clearly the main aim or goal of the proposal.
3. **Description:** Elaborate on what the proposal entails. The more specific, the better.
4. **Impact:** Highlight the potential consequences or benefits the proposal might bring.
5. **Implementation Strategy:** If relevant, describe a plan for executing the proposal.

_For example:_

Proposal Title: **Shortening the Alignment Duration for Acquiring bCC**

Objective: **The proposal aims to cut down the alignment timeframe required to obtain bCC from X days to Y days.**

Description: **This proposal suggests reducing the existing alignment duration of X days to Y days. The purpose of this change is to streamline the process of bCC acquisition and enhance engagement in governance.**

Potential Impact: **This change could potentially increase the number of bCC holders, thereby broadening the governance participant base. This could foster more frequent engagement in governance decisions.**

Implementation Strategy: **If the proposal is accepted, the developer team will alter the smart contract parameters to shorten the alignment period. The change will be thoroughly tested before the final rollout to prevent any associated bugs or risks.**
