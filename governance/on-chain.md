# On-Chain

This guide provides an overview of Cascadia's on-chain governance system, focusing on vote-escrowed CC as the determining factor for each account's voting power. This section covers various aspects of the governance system, such as:

<table><thead><tr><th width="213"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Parameters</td></tr><tr><td>Proposal Submission</td></tr><tr><td>Voting Process</td></tr><tr><td>Quorum </td></tr></tbody></table>



**Participation Requirements**&#x20;

To engage in Cascadia's on-chain governance, an account must hold bCC, a unique ERC20 implementation that defines an account's voting power.  It is non-transferable and can only be acquired by locking CC.

{% hint style="info" %}
In Cascadia, "locking" is more aptly referred to as "alignment".  This terminology better reflects the nature of the locking process within the Cascadia ecosystem.

{% hint style="info" %}
Cascadia's on-chain governance is designed to evolve over time. The parameters above are initial settings and may be updated as part of our evolving governance process.
