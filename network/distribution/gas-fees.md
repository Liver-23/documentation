# Gas Fees

Cascadiaâ€™s native token (CC) is used to pay for transactions and emitted as block rewards to validators.  CC can be locked into a vote-escrow contract in return for veCC.  On the Cascadia blockchain, gas rewards are initially split and distributed evenly by 1/3 between 3 parties: nProtocols, Validators, and veCC lockers that hold the vote-escrowed token (Figure 2).

For Cascadia to return a share of gas fees, even if an address has not yet created a ve-lock, a new cooldown lock type has been created, `create_cooldown_lock`, an adapted form that allows allows whitelisted addresses (lock\_bot) to create a lock for other addresses, which in turn enables set incentives, as per the specifications below.
