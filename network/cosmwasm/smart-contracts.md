# Smart Contracts

This section serves as a primer to the foundational concepts of CosmWasm Smart Contracts. While familiarity with Rust and Go can be advantageous, our guide is crafted to cater to both novices and experts. Our aim? Simple, lucid instructions offering tangible experience for newcomers through a sequential guide addressing the following:

* Environment setup
* Deploying a smart contract on the testnet
* Managing smart contract functions using the CLI
* Tweaking an existing contract

If you're eager to first unravel the underlying mechanisms or peruse detailed content, consider delving into the **Architecture** section. You can then circle back to this walkthrough.

**Scope:**\
Noticeably, this section doesn't delve into the nuances of smart contract development. The intentional design of this initial guide is to provide a seamless start, keeping intricacies of development for subsequent sections.

After setting up and engaging with the Cascadia testnet, we'll venture into enhancing the sample Escrow Contract in the 'Hijack Escrow' tutorial, incorporating a discreet command. This alteration serves a dual purpose: firstly, to acquaint users with the fabric of a smart contract and secondly, to underscore the imperative of scrutinizing a contract's source code before interaction.
