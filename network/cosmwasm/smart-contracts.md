# Smart Contracts

This section serves as a primer to the foundational concepts of CosmWasm Smart Contracts. The following sections are instructions addressing the following:

* Environment setup
* Deploying a smart contract on the testnet
* Managing smart contract functions using the CLI
* Tweaking an existing contract

**Scope**\
Noticeably, this section doesn't delve into the nuances of smart contract development. The intentional design of this initial guide is to provide a seamless start, keeping the intricacies of development for subsequent sections.

After the Cascadia testnet is up for testing, there will be sample guides on the contracts.
