# Requirements

The information requirements of Cascadiaâ€™s cybernetic systems are variable given the decisions on what to control.

* First, the initial setup of the system must choose precisely what output (either an intermediate output or a final output) characteristics will be controlled.
* Second, criteria must be established for each characteristic, including range of outputs.
* Third, sensors must be acquired that can measure those qualities with the necessary level of accuracy.
* Fourth, a signal that can be compared to a reference signal must be created from these observations.
* Fifth, the difference between the two is passed to the decision process, which, if it is significant enough, detects it.
* Sixth, the system sends a signal to the effectors (the agents that confirm and implement the decision), that prompt the operating system to take action to correct the deviation or any changes from the norm.  These effectors can be the control system (eventually) or various agents (contributors) who apply the action plan when a decision is made.
* Last, if the control system is set up properly by the decision-making process, it can choose between a number of different actions along with more information. The effectors must be given instructions on what action(s) to take by means of built-in or derived criteria like consciousness, memory, or recombination.&#x20;
