# System Design

Figure 1, below, displays a diagram of a first-order cybernetic control system.  A system is in operation with inputs being sent through a process that translates them into outputs.  Measurements taken by a sensor are transmitted for feedback, which compares them with a set of predetermined standards.  The difference is processed as a decision, which determines whether or not the difference is of sufficient size to deserve correction.  First-order systems are straightforward, goal-seeking control systems.  A standard has been established, and there is no provision for changing it without outside assistance.\

Figure 2, below, illustrates a second-order control system. These systems can change the system’s standards in accordance with a specified set of rules or programs. Second-order systems can range greatly in complexity, and usually include some degree of automation. For example, a thermostat becomes a second-order controller when a clock is added to it, allowing it to maintain varying temperatures during the day and night.

Cascadia seeks to integrate third-order systems.  A third-order control system, Figure 3, below, can alter its objectives.  It may opt to take action against the advice of its instructions after considering the operation of the system.  Third-order controllers can be trained to spot patterns and respond to patterns in particular ways.  These systems are believed to “learn.”  Third-order systems have the ability to learn without explicit preprogramming and change its course of action at will.  Third-order controllers have the benefit of being able to handle the unexpected and unforeseen.
